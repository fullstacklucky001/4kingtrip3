Hi, Matthew Mukherjee.

I am Raihan from Freelancer.

I just found the bad news my Freelancer account was blocked.

I can not understand why Freelancer made my account blocked.

I am very sad. I have lost lots of clients and much money.

I mentioned before, I am trying to do my best for your project.

But now my Freelancer account was blocked so I can not work via Freelancer.

But I can complete your project within your timeline and budget.

I focus on providing excellent client satisfaction.

I would love to be your developer and help you fix your issues.

Please show me your favor and hire me for your project.

Please do not hesitate to contact me.

Stay safe and have a good one!

From Raihan.

Thanks.
